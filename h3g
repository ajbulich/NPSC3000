c This is a KEPLER generator file.  This generates the initial model, defines

c various variables, configures various parameters, and provides a set of

c commands for KEPLER to execute.  I've attempted to comment all of this below.


c --- Network cards ---

c KEPLER has an in-built APPROX19 network (this is the origin of Frank's various

c approx networks).  You set the initial network to be APPROX by choosing net 1.

c As I understand it, you can currently only select network 1 (APPROX), though

c other networks are defined and can be configured to "turn on" later, such as

c an NSE (NETNUM = 3) network and an ISE (NETNUM = 2, a QSE net) network.


c Note that the large adaptive network is run in a co-processing fashion, such

c that isotope compositions and related quantities are mapped back and forth

c between a large network calculation and the simpler APPROX19 calculation.  You

c _do_ get energy generation and such from the adaptive network with the proper

c parameters, so you can effectively run with the large network as "the"

c network, but for legacy reasons will still need to define APPROX19 here and the

c larger network with a "bg" BURN generator.


c These net cards define the isotopes carried by the network.  Though this

c presents as a user option, Alex advises that you must define the APPROX19

c network as it has been made into a hard-coded assumption in various parts of

c the code.  So in practice, all modern Kepler generators will have the

c following set of net cards.

net 1 h1 he3 he4 n14 c12 o16 ne20 mg24

net 1 si28 s32 ar36 ca40 ti44 cr48 fe52

net 1 ni56 fe54 pn1 nt1


c --- Mixture cards ---

c Mixture cards allow you to define compositions that can then be used in other

c cards to specify the chemical composition at different regions in the grid.


c This composition is a proxy for the deeper part of the NS ocean, and is meant

c to just be a sink for heat.  We achieve this with an iron 54 substrate.

m nstar 1.00 fe54


c He star abundance references

c m acret 1.0 he4 0.0 c12 0.0 o16

c m acret 0.3 he4 0.2 c12 0.5 o16

c m acret 0. h1 0.980 he4 0. c12 0.02 n14 0. o16

c H star abundance references

c m acret 0.759 h1 0.24 he4 0.001 n14


c Here we define the composition of material accreted from the companion

m acret 0.05 h1 0.92 he4 0.01 n14 0.01 c12 0.01 o15


c --- Grid cards ---

c Grid cards define the initial 1D grid of mass zones, and make use of mixture

c cards.  These are the cards you use to define the initial resolution.  Not every

c zone needs to be specified.  Intermediate zones will have their data

c interpolated (not sure exactly in what form) from provided grid zones.  You must

c always define grid point 0 and the final grid point (which defines the initial

c resolution).

c --- Parameter cards ---

c Now we set various parameters configuring how Kepler will run.

c These can be found in the docs.

p he4hebrn -1.



c - Gridding and Boundaries -

c dstat says to take the specified initial grid configuration and adjust it to

c be in HSE via modifications of the density.  Docs say this is useful for

c degenerate cases like WD and NS, but I don't see why it wouldn't be useful in

c general.  Don't you always want HSE for stars?

dstat


c radius0: radius of inner boundary (cm)

p radius0 1.0e+06


c summ0: Mass inside inner boundary (g)

p summ0 2.8e+33

c radius gradients used to determine the necessity for adzoning or dezoning.

p fracrz2 .5

p fmax0 .01

p fmax1 .015


c fmax2: See fmax0 and docs, has to do with adzoning on mass fraction ranges

p fmax2 .03


c accrate: Rate at which mass in the form of new zones is added to the surface

c of the star (Msun/yr).

c

c The accumulated mass is stored in xmacrete (p# 212) until it is large enough

c to be added as a whole zone. The surface boundary pressure is gradually

c increased at a rate proportional to accrate until a mass (in xmacrete

c (p# 212)) equal to that in the current outer zone is reached. Then a new zone, the

c mirror image of the old outer zone, is added. Accretion composition is set by

c the compsurf command in TTYCOM. The boundary pressure from the accretion phantom

c is stored in pboundac (q# 96).

c

c Note: This prescription will work best for coarse and roughly equal surface zoning.

c

c Negative accretion rate means to read in time-dependent accretion rate data

c from file nameprob.acc. The file contains a comment line with version

c information, then a line with the number of entries ((I6)), then the data in two

c columns: time in seconds and accretion rate in grams per second. Format:

c (2E25.17). The resulting rate is multiplied by accrate to allow

c scaling without having to change the file. See also: accratef (p# 550) which

c seems to duplicate the scaling functionality.

p accrate 1.75d-9


c minzone: Do not rezone the innermost minzone zones

c minzone = 0 allows rezoning innermost zone

p minzone 51


c zonemmin: Minimum mass that a pair of zone may have and still be allowed to

p zonemmin 1.5d19


c zonemmax: Do not dezone zones bigger than zonemmax

p zonemmax 1.0d20








c - Convection -

c fracneut: If the semi convective test parameter, W, is < 0 but greater than

c -fracneut * abs(log(T1/T0)), then the zonal interface is flagged

c convectively neutral (“NEUT” or ”,”).

c one timestep is limited to approximately dtsmult

p dtsmult 1.e+99


c frcsound: Don't do convection if the absolute value of the zone velocity

c exceeds frcsound times the local sound speed.

c be further down but I don't think that matters)

p frcsound .0

p frcsound 1.


c convlim: Limit the convective velocity to a fraction convlim of the local sound speed

c (Note: this provided generator had two instances of this, the second used to

c be further down but I don't think that matters)

p convlim .0

p convlim 1.


c woversht: The semiconvective test parameter, W, is taken to be

c W = woversht * abs ( log (T1/T0)) for the special overshoot semiconvective

c zones where W would otherwise be < 0 and when Abar >= abarsemi (p# 324).

c If 0, no overshoot mixing.

p woversht 0.


c alpth: Efficiency factor for thermohaline convection

c If set to zero no thermohaline convection is considered. Thermohaline

c convections occurs in regions with destabilizing composition gradient, but

c stabilizing temperature gradient (salt finger instability).

c The implementation in KEPLER is according to Braun (1997, PhD thesis) and

c Kippenhahn et al. (1980)

c p alpth 0.



c - Microphysics -

c Below this mass coordinate, burn co-processing is turned off.

c (won't it always be off then?  All grid points are below this)

p bmasslow 2.800000019999895D33


c This specifies the BURN generator file's name.  See rpabg for the

c co-processing network's specification.

genburn rpabg


c Map the BURN abundances to the APPROX network.  This should overwrite any

c previously specified APPROX abundances, e.g. from the g cards.  In other

c words, the composition specified in rpabg takes precedence.

c than tnucmin

c NOTE: Unless the hydrogen burning rate is significant, no APPROX network

c calculations will be done below 1.e+7 K, even if tnucmin < 1.e+7 K

c (Note: this provided generator had two instances of this, the second used to

c be further down but I don't think that matters)

p tnucmin 1.0e+99

c component) if it is >= 0. Otherwise, the old non-relativistic, partial

c degeneracy model for the ion EOS is used.

p wilsonmt -1.


c iold: Set to value other than 0 to use old physics - mostly fix that energy

c generation in APPROX did not include neutrino losses and mass excess but only

c considered differences in binding energy.

c 0 -> use current physics

c 1 -> no nu loss in H burning and BE instead of ME and old nu loss routines

c      (old1/old2, < 1997)

c other options (2,4,8, see docs)

p iold 1


c kaptab: Select opacity table

c 0 -> old (??)

p kaptab 0


c btempmin: BURN co-processing is skipped if a zone's temperature is less than

c btempmin

c be further down but I don't think that matters)

p btempmin 1.1e8

p btempmin 1.d7


c mazful: Use Fuller et. al.'s weak rates in the BURN coprocessor

c if mazful = 1, otherwise use the old rates of Mazurek and Hansen

c sure why it's set to 5 here.  Should ask Alex.

p iautoout 5

c coupled to the ion equation of state only if iflgabar /= 0 and the normal

c APPROX network is being used.

p iflgabar 0
